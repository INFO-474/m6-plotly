Exercise 2
----------

##Part 0

The first part of this exercise is just a quick introduction to making
a chart on plotly. This exercise can also be found on plotly's website
but I put it here for convenience.

##Part 2

The second part covers a few topics in web development and looks
more in depth at plotly. There is some starter code that handles
authentication and page styling but you will be writing most of the
javascript. Topic covered include REST APIs, AJAX, jQuery, caching
in JavaScript, and grouped bar charts in plotly.
