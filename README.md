# Module 6: Plotly

## Overview
In this module, you'll start building visualizations using the Plotly API. Plotly is a visualization software that recently open-sourced it's API to JavaScript, Python, and R, making it quite valuable to learn. Plotly graphs are fairly customizable, and (by default) have a variety of interactive methods with each chart (i.e., hover, brush to zoom, pan, etc.). Many of these events are fairly cumbersome to build programmatically, which makes a library like Plotly quite attractive. Unfortunately, you will be restrained to the chart types that come _"out of the box"_, which is why we will later learn the D3 library. That being said, there are tons of use cases for using a library like Plotly, and understanding it's charting methods can help you better design your own visualization software from scratch.
